# Reconstruction Scenes

In this repository, I am uploading all the scenes that have been used for testing our methods for next-best-view planning, object reconscturcion and scene mapping. The objective is to facilitate the reproducibility of our experiments.

### Blender Scenes

In some simulations, we have used the blender range sensor simulator. In the blender folder I am including all these files.
